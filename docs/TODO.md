# TODO

  * Currently validators/constraints just return a boolean. Need to add some sort of context to this.
  * Implement the unimplemented core constraints.
  * Add boiler plate to easily add constraints to EmptyConstraint dynamically.
  * shoulc be `Constraint::build(context)` not `Constraint::build(doc, context)`.
